b//a                =
b**a                =
b%a                 =
a+B                 =
type(42)            =
type(42.0)          =
type("C3PO")        =
type(True)          =



3.) What is the final output of (a) and type(a) if you enter the following 5 lines
into the Python Console Window?

a=2
a*=10
a/=2
a+=12
a-=7

a             =
type(a)       =



4.) Fix the mistake in the following code.
x,y = (4,5)
a = 3(x + y)

5.) Fix the code so it will calculate the average.
