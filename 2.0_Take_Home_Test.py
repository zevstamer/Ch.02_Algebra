HONOR CODE: I solemnly promise that while taking this test I will only use PyCharm or the Internet,
but I will definitely not ask another person except the instructor. Signed: ______________________

1.) How do you enter a single line comment in a program?




2.) What do the following lines of code output? ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
2 / 3
2 // 3
3/2
3//2





3.) What happens when you try this and why?
A = 22
b = 13
c = a+b






4.) All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is the better variable name to use?
a
A
Area
AREA
area
area_of_rectangle
Area_Of_Rectangle





5.) Which of these variables names are NOT allowed in Python? 
Test them if you aren't sure.

apple
Apple
APPLE
Apple2
1Apple
account number
account_number
account.number
accountNumber
account#
pi
PI
fred
Fred
GreatBigVariable
greatBigVariable
great_big_variable
great.big.variable
2x
x2x
total%
#left






6.) Predict the output of (a) and its type and then test it?
a =2
a*=10
a/=2
a+=12
a-=7
a
type(a)







7.) This program runs, but the code still could be better. How?
radius = 10
x = 3.14
pi = x
area = pi  * radius ** 2
area






8.) What is the output of each of these?
type(42)
type(42.0)
type("C3PO")
type(True)







9.) Fix the mistake in the following code:
x = 4
y = 5
a = 3(x + y)
a






10.)Why does this code not calculate the average?
x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave = x+y+z/3
ave
